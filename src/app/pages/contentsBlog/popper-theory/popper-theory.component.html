      Karl Popper (1902-1994) was an Austrian-British philosopher and academic. He is considered one
      of the greatest philosophers of science, having made a distinction between science (hard science)
      and pseudo-science (social science).

      He born in the 19th century and see Freud and Eistein doing science in a different way. Freud
      became famous saying that childhood experiences would have a heavy bearing on who we grew up to
      be, meanwhile Einstein made important discoveries about the behaviour of the light. While Freud
      was looking backward, using past data to predict the present, Einstein was looking ahead, trying
      to predict the future.

      For Popper, methods like Freud only served to confirm beliefs. They could be used to prove
      anything. It is easy to find confirmation of a theory if you are looking for it. For example,
      considering the existence of Santa Claus, if you are looking for evidence that he exists, it´s
      is easy to find, presents are under the tree on Christmas morning, songs, stories, movies and
      the guy at the mall. An example more realistic is the black swan theory, if you just see white
      swan, the pseudo-science can affirm that all swan is white. Popper was concern about the
      limitation of human prediction and knowledge in the face of highly unlikely and unpredictable
      events.

      In conclusion, the only genuine test of a theory is one that attempts to falsify it. Every
      Scientific theory must be testable, refutable and falsifiable. You don’t seek to prove scientific
      hypotheses right, it´s the contrary.
